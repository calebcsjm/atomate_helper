For the functions in this file to work properly, please create the following additional three files in the same directory: `password.txt`, `api_key.txt`, and `db.json`. `password.txt` and `api_key.txt` should both only have one line of text, containing the admin password for the mongoDB and the Materials Project API key, respectively. The `db.json file` is a copy of the `db.json` file you created on the supercomputer, for use in querying the database.
