For the functions in this file to work properly, please create the following additional two files in the same directory: `api_key.txt` and `db.json`. `api_key.txt` should only have one line of text, containing your Materials Project API key. The `db.json file` is a copy of the `db.json` file you created on the supercomputer, for use in querying the database. 

To take advantage of the great functionality provided by the builders (which summarizes the info from all previous runs with a given structure into one document), periodically run the `run_builders.py` program from the terminal.
