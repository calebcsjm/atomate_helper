# atomate_helper
A library of functions to make it easier to work with Atomate.

These are a group of functions written while working with BYU's Computational Materials group (under Dr. Homer) to make it easier to use Atomate. The functions require a working installation of atomate that is already connected to the user's Mongo database.
