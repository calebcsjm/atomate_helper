# atomate_helper
A library of functions to make it easier to work with Atomate.

These are a group of functions written while working with BYU's Computational Materials group (under Dr. Homer) to make it easier to use Atomate. The functions require a working installation of atomate that is already connected to the user's Mongo database. 

You can `git clone` this repository into Jupyter Notebooks, and then you will simply need to create your notebooks in the same directory as the `.py` files in order to import the functions. 

For help on installing Atomate or dealing with errors from VASP or Atomate, please see the notes section.
